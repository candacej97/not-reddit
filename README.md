# Link Aggregator

## Description

Create a link aggregator site (like reddit, hacker news, etc.) that supports user registration and loginâ€¦ along with the ability to post articles (links).

Registering or logging in will create an authenticated session that contains all of the logged in user's information. Some elements on pages will only appear when a user is logged in. Some pages will redirect to login if a user arrives unauthenticated.

### Goals

* use bcrypt.js to salt and hash a password and to compare a hash to a plain text password
* use the slides on authentication to implement login and registration
* use express-session to store user data / an authenticated session
* use embedded or related documents to model users and posted articles
* extract path components to determine what data to use to render a page

### Features

1. register a new account
2. login using an existing account
3. add a new article
4. view all posted articles
5. show a single article's details
6. prevent / allow access to certain ui elements or pages based on authenticated status

### Routes

/register - register form
/login - login form
/article/add - add new article form
/article/:slug - detail page for a specific article
